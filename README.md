###Project: WalWear

WalWear is an online platform where users attempt to design an outfit for a mannequin and later share their design to the world. Through the use of Walmart API, users can choose a varierty of products from the Walmart catalog for their design. The idea is for users to try to collect as many likes as possible on their design, by either sharing the link with a friend or by sharing it on Facebook. The users with the most likes can be compensated by Walmart with a prize that includes all of the items from their design. This is a win-win situation for both parties. A user will be compensated with free items and Walmart will get greater recognition on social media by spreading their name.
